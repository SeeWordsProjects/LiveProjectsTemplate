# I need to see your words

**Challenge Rating: 2/5 -> 4/5**

My Nan is 101. Nice going, Nan! She's nearly blind and absolutely deaf, though. The only way I can communicate with her is with a small whiteboard, and large black pen. She loves a hug, too.

You may ask; why on earth would you want to improve on the whiteboard and pen? It's simple, cheap and effective.

No, it isn't. 

The white board doesn't stay white. The pens run out.

You can fit a maximum of 8 words on the white board, so it's very difficult to have a conversation.

People who visit my Nan can't use it. 

I know - it sounds ridiculous, but they can't! 

They take too long to write what they need to say. 

They write too small, or illegibly.

… and they don't plan what they are going to write.

So their last couple of words are squashed up against the edge of the board.

The only thing the the whiteboard is good at is Noughts and Crosses (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe)

We need a better solution. And so do loads of other people in our situation.

We're going to need an app for that.

We're going to release it on the App Stores, so that everyone can benefit.

## Proposal

Repurpose an old tablet, to take the place of the whiteboard (Did you know you can pick up an iPad 1 for £25? )

Tablet in Kiosk Mode, so it can't be used for anything else.

A single communications app with the following functions:

1. Speech-to-text technology, using a bluetooth or connected microphone

2. keyboard, using a bluetooth keyboard

3. Scrolling Words:

   * Full-screen
   * Black on White - high contrast
   * Large Font
   * Single Line
   * Tap and hold. Speak into the microphone. Words scroll across the screen
   * Type on the keyboard. Words scroll across the screen.


   * Pause a little while or Tap the screen, or press return on the keyboard to start another stream of words.
   * Drag / Throw the words backward and forward.
   * Dissapearing menu, adds controls for:
     * scroll speed
     * font size
     * whiteboard mode toggle
     * keyboard pairing
     * microphone pairing
     * speech on / off

4. Whiteboard

   1. Full Screen
   2. Black on White - high contrast
   3. Use finger to paint
   4. Button to clear
